In order to update changes, you will need to run the following:</p><div class="language-bash"><span class="copy"></span><pre><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">git remote add template https://github.com/profectus-engine/Profectus</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">git fetch --all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre></div><p>The first command only has to be performed once. The third command may require you to merge conflicts between code both you and Profectus have changed - however, due to the modularity of Profectus, this should be fairly rare. Unfortunately, due to the unrelated histories the first time you do this <em>every</em> change will be marked as a conflict, and you&#39;ll need to accept each one.</p><h2 id="replit" tabindex="-1">Replit <a class="header-anchor" href="#replit" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The sidebar has a tab labelled &quot;Version Control&quot;, which you can use to merge all changes made to Profectus into your project. Unfortunately, replit does not have a merge tool so this process may irrecoverably erase changes you&#39;ve made - I&#39;d recommend making a backup first.</p><h2 id="glitch" tabindex="-1">Glitch <a class="header-anchor" href="#glitch" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Unfortunately glitch does not provide any method by which to update a project from a github repository. If you&#39;ve only changed things in the data folder you may consider creating a new project, importing the current version of Profectus, and then placing your data folder in the new project.</p>`,9),i=[n];function s(l,c,d,h,p,u){return a(),t("div",null,i)}var m=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
