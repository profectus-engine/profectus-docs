This is done mostly by changing the values of various CSS variables. You can look at the existing themes as a reference for the kind of values these CSS variables expect.

Removing themes from the enum and exported object will similarly hide them from the dropdown.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to change which theme is the default, you may modify the initial player settings object in the <code>/src/game/settings.ts</code> file.
