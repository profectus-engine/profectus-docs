# Profectus API

This section of the docs is generated via the doc comments inside the Profectus source code. While it can be used as a reference, the comments themselves should show up in your IDE when relevant, which is probably a better way to get help. The [guide](/guide/) has longer-form explanations of key concepts and is more likely to be of use to new developers.
