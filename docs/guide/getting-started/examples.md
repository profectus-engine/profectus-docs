This is a project that's still under development, but is a good resource for things like implementing custom features.

[View Source](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/advent-Incremental/) | [View Project](https://www.thepaperpilot.org/advent/)

An incremental game with 25 different layers of content. A good example of what a large project looks like. There's also a partial port to 0.6 available [here](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/advent-Incremental/tree/next).

## Primordia <Badge type="warning" text="Profectus 0.5" />

A "The Prestige Tree" style incremental game, developed by the original creator of TPT.

[View Source](https://github.com/profectus-engine/tmt-demo) | [View Project](https://profectus-engine.github.io/TMT-Demo/)

A project loosely based off the Demo project for TMT. Uses most of the different features of Profectus, but doesn't have any real gameplay.
