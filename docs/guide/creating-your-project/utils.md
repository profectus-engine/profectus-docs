# Utilities

There are often concepts that aren't inherent to a single feature, but rather work with joining different features together. For example, a reset clickable that activates a conversion and resets a tree, which happens to be a common use case but isn't inherent to clickables, conversions, or trees.

These are perfect situations for utilities, and so to encourage creators to learn to identify and take advantage of these situations, a file called `src/data/common.tsx` has been created to demo some of the more common utility functions a project might use. Adding new utilities to this file is encouraged, as is creating utils in general. It also works as a good stepping stone to creating your own features.
